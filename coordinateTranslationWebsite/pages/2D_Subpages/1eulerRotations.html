    <p>With a third basis vector added to the coordinate frame, the rotation that we performed in the first chapter can now be visualized, not as an abstract rotation, but as a specific rotation around the third axis. In Figure 1, we show both a
      "left" and a "right"-handed rotation about <span class="math inline"><strong>e</strong><sub>3</sub></span>. This can be viewed as putting your thumb in the same direction as axis <span class="math inline"><strong>e</strong><sub>3</sub></span>
      and the direction your fingers point is the way a "positive" rotation will occur.</p>
    <p>The mathematical representation of this rotation is very similar to what we had in 2-D, namely:
      <br>
      <br>

      </span><br /> Note that this represents a "right"-handed rotation about the <span class="math inline"><em>z</em></span> axis.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> It is also denoted as <span
        class="math inline"><em>C</em><sub>3</sub></span> to show that we are rotating about the third axis.</p>
    <p>If, instead, we wanted to rotate about a different axis, we could follow a very similar pattern, namely:<br />
      <strong>Rotation about <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>:</strong>
      <br />
      <br>
      <img src="../../images/referenceFrames/matrix_example2.png" width="284" height="95" alt="Example 1" style="border:2px solid black; display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" />
      <br>
      <strong>Rotation about <span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>:</strong> <br />
      <br>
      <img src="../../images/referenceFrames/matrix_example3.png" width="289" height="97" alt="Example 1" style="border:2px solid black; display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" />
      <br>
    <p>There is a pattern to these matrices that is worth discussing. First, the axis which is being rotated about has a column and row with two 0s and one 1. So, equations <b>(2)</b>, <b>(3)</b>, and <b>(1)</b> represent (right-handed) rotations
      around the <b>x</b>, <b>y</b>, and <b>z</b> axes, respectively. Second, because these are right-handed rotations, the row right after the axis being rotated over has the positive sin θ term, and the line after that has the negative term. For
      Equations <b>(2)</b> and <b>(1)</b> this is easy to see. For Equation <b>(3)</b>, note that the 3rd row comes after the <b>y</b> row, and it has a positive sin θ term, while the first row (following the third row) has the − sin θ value.</p>
    <p>Tying back into chapter one, note that all of these rotations are assumed to be <em>reference frame</em> rotations and not object rotations. If they were object rotations, the rows following the axis being rotated around would have - sin
      values.</p>
